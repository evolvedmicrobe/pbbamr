# The R extensions manual says we should specify a C++11 flag with this environmental variable
# 
# CXX_STD = CXX11
#
# and also set the requirements file to list both.  However, this will totally goof the install
# if the R Makeconf file is poorly formed, in particular missing entries for:
# 
# CXX1X
# CXX1XFLAGS
# CXX1XPICFLAGS
# CXX1XSTD
#
# If any of those variables are missing, the compilation process will fail when no compiler is
# passed to the command line to do the loading (because if the variable isn't set, it just 
# outputs an empty string "" as the name of the compiler/linker).
#
# Once we consistently use version R > 3.1 which has better C++11 support this variable can be set again.
